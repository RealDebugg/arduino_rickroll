I made this whilst bored, I dont plan on releaseing "real" wiring diagrams for the actual project - but use this code and modify it if you'd like.
It uses an arduino micro and old desk phone which allows you to press a button on a remote. After which the phone will start calling. Once picked up, it waits one second and plays a rickroll using an external sound card with the mp3 file loaded on it
